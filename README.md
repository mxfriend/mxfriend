This repository contains a number of NodeJS packages which allow you
to write code to interact with the Behringer X32 / X-Air and Midas M32 / M-Air
mixing consoles in various ways, as well as a number of opinionated utilities
which the author personally uses.

This is very much a work in progress as of April 2022; for now nothing is really
complete, but in the coming months things should gradually pop up. If you're
interested in collaborating on this project, please feel free to reach out
via my [personal GitHub profile](https://github.com/jahudka).
